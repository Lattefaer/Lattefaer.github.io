I a am a PhD student at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University College of Computing. 
My research is centred around Distributed ML algorithms. The goal of thesis is to build algorithms that mitigate performance or safety challenges that face Distributed ML either due to data heterogeneity or Byzantine behavior. Prior to that, I obtained a software enginnering degree from the National School Of Computer Science (ENSIAS) in Morocco.
